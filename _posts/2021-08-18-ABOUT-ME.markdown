<p>I am a student at the School of Xuteli which recruits the best students of BIT and aims to cultivate talented researchers. Thanks to its flexible policy, I was able to know my advisor Prof. <a href="http://shuangli.xyz/" target="_blank">Shuang Li</a> and start my research career.</p>
<p>As for my personality, I am a hardworking and conscientious student and can always finish my work with good quality before the deadline. Also, I  am a quick learner, and I'm always willing to learn new knowledge by myself.</p>
